# Unai Reminder

UNAI Reminder is an alarm application for the study schedule of the Adventist University of Indonesia. This app is made using flutter. The app will remind students of today's schedule automatically when the app is opened. Some features are still in the checking stage, so don't hesitate to attach existing issues to increase comfort in using this application.

## Getting Started

Some things that need to be considered in using Unai Reminder are:

- Highly recommended to make sure the internet connection is good when you want to log in.
- Enter the same credential/account as the Indonesian Adventist University Student Module.
- Please turn on autostart mode when requested by the application to solve the problem of notifications not appearing.
- If you think there is an error in the schedule output, please exit the application and log back in (cases like this occur because the internet connection is weak and still under developer checking).

Thank you for using Unai Reminder.
