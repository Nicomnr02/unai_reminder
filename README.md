# UNAI Reminder

UNAI Reminder is an alarm application for the study schedule of the Adventist University of Indonesia. This app is made using flutter. The app will remind users of today's schedule automatically when the app is opened. Some features are still in the checking stage, so don't hesitate to attach existing issues to increase comfort in using this application.


## Getting Started

Some things that need to be considered in using Unai Reminder are:

- Highly recommended to make sure the internet connection is good when you want to log in.
- Enter the same credential/account as the Indonesian Adventist University Student Module.
- If you think there is an error in the schedule output, please exit the application and log back in (cases like this occur because the internet connection is weak and still under developer checking).
- Some devices don't get notifications because they have strict rules regarding processes running in the background during battery optimization.

## FAQ
### Does this app support to invoke a notification after reboot?
- From the Android AlarmManager documentation: 
  Registered alarms are retained while the device is asleep (and can optionally wake the device up if they go off during that time), but will be cleared if it is turned   off and rebooted. https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager

### UNAI Reminder is not firing on a specific device
- The device is running some battery optimization software that is preventing the notification from firing.


Thank you for using Unai Reminder
