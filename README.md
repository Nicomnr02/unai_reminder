# Unai Reminder

UNAI Reminder is a reminder application (android) for the Adventist University of Indonesia study schedule. This app is made using Flutter. The app will automatically remind students of today's schedule once the students log in. Some features are still in the checking stage, so don't hesitate to attach existing issues to increase comfort in using this application.

## Getting Started

- Highly recommended to make sure the internet connection is good when you want to log in.
- Enter the same credential/account as the Indonesian Adventist University Student Module.
- Please turn on autostart mode when requested by the application to solve the problem of notifications not appearing (autostart page directing in Samsung is still under development).
- If you see there is an error in the schedule output, please exit the application and log back in (cases like this occur because the internet connection is weak and still under checking).
- You will be reminded of your offline schedule once logged in. But if you turn off your phone and turn it on later, the notifications of your upcoming schedule will not appear, since I didn't put in the code to isolate the task while the device was turned off. So, please launch the app again. (hehe I'm still learning this one.)

Thank you for using Unai Reminder.
